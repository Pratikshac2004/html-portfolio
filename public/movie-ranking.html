<h1>The Best Movies According to Pratiksha</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Sitaramam</h3>
<p>This is my fav movie of love.<br />
It shows how innocent love looks like,<br />
just like old-love without any intentions,<br />
without any intimate scenes.<br />
just pure love one can experience.<br />
</p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>This is anime movie.<br />
I love the storyline of this movie.<br />  
I also love the visuals and animation of this movie<br />

<h3>Maharashtra Shahir</h3>
<p>This best film based on biography of well-known marathi singer.<br />
So this film shows how his life went through singing journey and has many plots in between.<br />
It has songs that u will like it.<br />
If you love music then u should definitely watch it.<br />
